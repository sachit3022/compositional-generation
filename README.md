### Repository structure
Source code is present in CoInD repository. This repository consits of training module to train your models with CoInD built on lightning, huggingface and hydra for config management. 
  -  CoInD/
    - models ( Backbone for conditional denoising UNet / DiT ) 
    - inference ( Code to perform sampling with AND and OR operations)
    - score ( CoInD modules required for training: Loss, Noise schedule, EMA, ....)
    - datasets ( Code to load datasets in a respective format )
    - train.py ( training code integrating all the modules )
    - inference.py ( let's you control the generation and store the module)
    - evaluate
        - FID.py
        - confirmity_score.py
        - jsd.py
        - model_report.py
    - scripts
        - extract_latent.py ( To increase the speedup of the latent space diffsusion models, we pre-compute latents and store in the data folder )
  - config/ ( For config mangement we leverage hydra )
